            Currently, I am working as a Strategic Student Program Intern where I actively use
            C++ to develop an "Coatings" application in the company's NX software. Here, we actively
            utilize JIRA, Visual Studio, and DOUG, their source control tool, to maximize our
            efficiency.

            My second summer internship at VIZIO, I was in charge of designing intranet sites for
            the Legal and I.T. teams using Sharepoint. I also developed a jQuery Page linked to Google
            Analytics that would track the number of times a file had been downloaded.

            The first summer internship at VIZIO, I gathered data for each of the VIZIO products
            into a .csv file where they would be input into a SAP database. Afterwards, I designed
            basic webpages for each product using HTML and CSS.

              Planeater was a project that me and my friend undertook in our sophomore year of college.
              It was created with the purpose of solving all of our pesky four year plan problems. So after hours of free time utilized throughout the school year
              we created a working product that is linked to UCI's list of classes, allows logins through Google and lets the user save and load their 4 year plan.
